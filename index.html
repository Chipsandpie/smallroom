Although it may looks....a little ...ugly,but we were very satisfied.I hope we can make a better thing in the future!</h3>

      On october 22nd,this is our second "code2things"class.This time we learn to use "Fushion360"and"Inkscape".And we used a laser printer to make a "signboard" for our class.And....I have to say we made the same mistake.Our pattern was too small and we fail to print the letters.This is the picture of our work....I think it was not very bad,right?Still we think the machine was very useful and maybe we can make more things next time~
